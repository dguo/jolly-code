## Contributing
Please feel free to submit an issue or pull request. The website is simple
enough to not require a build process. Just open `public/index.html` in a
browser.

If you want [live reloading](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) and have
Node installed, run `$ yarn install && yarn start`. If you have Python and
Docker installed, you can run `$ ./dev start` instead.
